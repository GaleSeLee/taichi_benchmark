# Taichi Benchmark

<!-- Purpose -->
The Taichi programming language is knwon for attaining high performance with easily underatndable programs. The elegant parallel programming style has attracted thousands of users to the Taichi community and we improve the compiler together. Unlike programming style that one can evaluate with a single glance at the code, performance is a much more complex topic to measure. As a domain-specific language (DSL), Taichi has its own problem set to solve. Therefore, we kick off the Taichi benchmark project to answer the two questions: 1) How fast is Taichi? and 2) How much faster can Taichi progress in the future? In this repository, we exhibits Taichi's performance on a set of benchmarks and compare with equivalent CUDA implementations. We also evaluate the [roofline model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline_model) when possible.
