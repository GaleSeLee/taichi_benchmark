# Taichi Benchmark

<!-- Purpose -->
The Taichi programming language is knwon for attaining high performance with easily understandable programs. The elegant parallel programming style has attracted thousands of users to the Taichi community and we improve the compiler together. 
Compared with programming styles, performance cannot easily measure with a single glance at the code. Moreover, general benchmark cases are insuitable as Taichi is a domain-specific language (DSL) with its own problem set to solve. 

Therefore, we kick off the Taichi benchmark project to answer two questions regarding compute performance: 1) how fast is Taichi and 2) how much faster can Taichi progress in the future. In this repository, we exhibit Taichi's performance on a set of benchmarks and compare with equivalent CUDA implementations. We also evaluate with the [roofline model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roofline_model) when possible.
